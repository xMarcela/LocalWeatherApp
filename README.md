# Local Weather App Development
Tema 8

# Description
* A web development project where I built an local feature app with what I've learned during practice
at school and during the project. Specifically without any framework.

* The main aim was to identify additional features to improve on the project after its initial stage, 
implement them and then deploy the application for mobile and desktop OS.

* I chose to create an Weather App that could also give a range of availble events for that specific city
in which you searched for, and adding a background function so it would show an image for your searched
city.

# Technologies
* During this project I've worked on UI development with Figma as design tool, because it was a new
software for me and an good opportunity to learn. I spent more time at this stage than planned, as to 
learn the software better tok more than anticipated.

* The brief required the use of and main focus on posssibility of exporting HTML/ CSS/ JS applications
for both mobile and desktop and developing a better understanding for the process of working with API's
and implementing these in the project.

* For the API's I chose to implement: Weather data from OpenWeatherMap as Ive worked with this previously
and know the data provided as secure. For the Events data from Ticketmaster Developer API this was a true
learning opportunity and a good challenge to work with. 

# Future Features Plans
* Fully functional Event searcher
* Location map
* Set user profile with history events for registered users
* App sharing between registered friends
* Exporting for use to Electron / Cordova
